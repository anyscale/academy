    "**Note**: The material has been updated to the lastest Ray version, so video presentation may not match with content. Some of the tutorials have been retired in this module, and they reside in nthe `retired` directory. We wanted these modules to be quick and simple and, therefore, remove all library dependencies on unecessary rendering \n",

    "This tutorial, part of [Anyscale Academy](https://anyscale.com/academy), provides a \"just the facts\" introduction to [Ray](https://ray.io), the system for scaling your Python and ML applications from a laptop to a cluster. Here, we start with a hands on exploration of the core Ray API for distributed work loads:\n",

    "* Ray _tasks_: Distributed execution of _stateless_ Python functions.\n",
    "* Ray _actors_: Distributed execution of _stateful_ Python classes.\n",
    "* Ray _ObjectRef_: Distributed Object Store for storing Future ObjectRefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent lessons explore the origin and goals for Ray, the rest of the core [Ray](https://ray.io) API ([documentation](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/package-ref.html)), working with Ray clusters using the `ray` command-line interface (CLI), Ray replacement versions of several popular multiprocessing APIs.\n",
