That has been fine for this tutorial so far, but what if you're waiting for a number of tasks, where some will finish more quickly than others? What if you would like to process the completed results as they become available, even while other tasks are still running? That's where `ray.wait()` is recommended.

This limits the size of `N` we can evaluate (as I confirmed by locking up my laptop...). However, this isn't actually necessary. We could do the same calculation in \"blocks, for example `m` blocks of size `N/m` and then combine the results. Furthermore, there's no dependencies between the calculations with those blocks, giving us further potential speed-up by parellelizing them with Ray.\n",
