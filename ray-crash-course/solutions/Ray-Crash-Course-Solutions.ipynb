    "As currently written, the memory footprint of `estimate_pi` scales linearly with `N`, because it allocates two NumPy arrays of size `N`. This limits the size of `N` we can evaluate (as I confirmed by locking up my laptop...). However, this isn't actually necessary. We could do the same calculation in \"blocks, for example `m` blocks of size `N/m` and then combine the results. Furthermore, there's no dependencies between the calculations with those blocks, giving us further potential speed-up by parellelizing them with Ray.\n",

    "The standard deviation is misleading now, because the number of trials change. The errors are roughly within an order of magnitude, due in part to expected statistical variation. Generally speaking, larger `N` and lower `trials` had lower errors. This may be due to the other big source of variation, the inevitable rounding error computing $\\pi$ (`4 * inside_count/N`), one time per trial (`1` to `10,000` times). Experiments are supposed to eliminate as many extraneous variables as possible, so I would argue that sticking to one value for `trials` and varying `N` is more meaningful. In fact, in the implementation that follows, we'll eliminate the potential rounding error variation by keep track of the inside and total counts, then computing $\\pi$ once at the end."
