    "### Concept for this Exercise - Remote Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard way to turn a Python function into a *remote function* is to add the `@ray.remote` decorator. Here is an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A regular Python function.\n",
    "def regular_function():\n",
    "    return 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# A Ray remote function.\n",
    "@ray.remote\n",
    "def remote_function():\n",
    "    return 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The differences are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Invocation:** The regular version is called with `regular_function()`, whereas the remote version is called with `remote_function.remote()`.\n",
    "2. **Return values:** `regular_function` immediately executes and returns `1`, whereas `remote_function` immediately returns an *object ref* (a future) and then creates a task that will be executed on a worker process. The result can be obtained with `ray.get`.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    >>> regular_function()\n",
    "    1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> remote_function.remote()\n",
    "    ObjectID(1c80d6937802cd7786ad25e50caf2f023c95e350)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> ray.get(remote_function.remote())\n",
    "    1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. **Parallelism:** Invocations of `regular_function` happen **serially**, for example\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # These happen serially.\n",
    "    for _ in range(4):\n",
    "        regular_function()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    whereas invocations of `remote_function` happen in **parallel**, for example\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # These happen in parallel.\n",
    "    for _ in range(4):\n",
    "        remote_function.remote()\n",
