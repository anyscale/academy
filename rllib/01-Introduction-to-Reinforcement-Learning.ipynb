    "_Reinforcement Learning_ is the category of machine learning that focuses on training one or more _agents_ to achieve maximal _rewards_ while operating in an environment. This lesson discusses the core concepts of RL, while subsequent lessons explore RLlib in depth. We'll use two examples with exercises to give you a taste of RL. If you already understand RL concepts, you can either skim this lesson or skip to the [next lesson](02-About-RLlib.ipynb)."

    "![RL Concepts](../images/rllib/RL-concepts.png)\n",

    "In RL, an **agent** interacts with an **environment** to maximize a **reward**. The agent makes **observations** about the **state** of the environment and takes **actions** that it believes will maximize the long-term reward. However, at the moment, it can only observe the immediate reward and it remembers past rewards. So, the training process usually involves lots and lot of reply of the game, the robot simulator traversing a virtual space, etc., so the agent can learn from repeated trials what decisions/actions work best to maximal the long-term reward."

    "### Markov Decision Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's understand RL in more technical terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The key abstraction in reinforcement learning is the Markov Decision Process (MDP).**\n",
    "\n",
    "An MDP models sequential interactions with an external environment. It consists of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a **state space**\n",
    "- a set of **actions**\n",
    "- a **transition function** that describes the probability of being in a state $s'$ at time $t+1$ given that the MDP was in state $s$ at time $t$ and action $a$ was taken.\n",
    "- a **reward function**, which determines the reward received at time $t$.\n",
    "- a **discount factor** $\\gamma$, which is used when calculating the cumulative reward from the rewards received after each action is taken. It is used to \"discount\" earlier rewards vs. more recent rewards. The value is between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details about MDP are available [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process). Note what we said in the third bullet, that the new state only depends on the previous state and the action taken. The assumption is that we can simplify our effort by ignoring all the previous states except the last one and still achieve good results. This is known as the [Markov property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property).\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Reinforcement learning algorithms are often applied to problems that don't strictly fit into the MDP framework. In particular, situations in which the state of the environment is not fully observed lead to violations of the MDP assumption. Nevertheless, RL algorithms can be applied anyway."

    "\n",
    "A **policy** is a function that takes in a **state** and returns an **action**. A policy may be stochastic (i.e., it may sample from a probability distribution) or it can be deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **goal of reinforcement learning** is to learn a **policy** for maximizing the cumulative reward in an MDP. That is, we wish to find a policy $\\pi$ which solves the following optimization problem\n",

    "\n",
    "A number of algorithms are available for solving reinforcement learning problems. Several of the most widely known are [value iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process#Value_iteration), [policy iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process#Policy_iteration), and [Q learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning), which we'll explore."
