    "## What Are Hyperparameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "In _supervised learning_, we train a model with labeled data so the model can properly label new data values. Everything about the model is defined by a set of _parameters_, such as the weights in a linear regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the _hyperparameters_<sup>1</sup> define structural details about the kind of model itself, like whether or not we are using a linear regression or what architecture is best for a neural network, etc. Other quantities considered hyperparameters include learning rates, discount rates, etc. If we want our training process and resulting model to work well, we first need to determine the optimal or near-optimal set of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we determine the optimal hyperparameters? The most straightfoward approach is to perform a loop where we pick a candidate set of values from some reasonably inclusive list of possible values, train a model, compare the results achieved with previous loop iterations, and pick the set that performed best. This process is called _Hyperparameter Tuning_ or _Optimization_ (HPO).\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple algorithm can quickly become very expensive, however. Training a single neural networks can be compute intensive and the space of all possible architectures is huge. Hence, much of the research in hyperparameter tuning, especially for neural networks, focuses on ways to optimize HPO, such as early stopping and pruning the search space when some combinations appear to perform poorly.\n",

    "Let's start with a very simple example of HPO, finding $k$ in $k$-means. \n",
    "\n",
    "The $k$-means algorithm finds clusters in a data set. It's a canonical example of _unsupervised learning_, where information is extracted from a data set, rather than using labeled data to train a model for labelling new data, as in _supervised learning_. We won't discuss the algorithm details, but the essense of it involves a \"guess\" for the expected number of clusters, the $k$ value, then calculating $k$ centroids (the coordinates at the center), one per cluster, along with determining to which cluster each data point belongs. The details are in [$k$-means Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering). The following animation shows the algorithm in action for a two-dimensional data set where three clusters are evident.\n",

In this case, \"best\" would mean that we minimize the distances between the datapoints and centroids. \n",
