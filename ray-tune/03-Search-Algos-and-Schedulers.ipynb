    "## About Search Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Tune integrates many [open source optimization libraries](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/api_docs/suggestion.html), each of which defines the parameter search space in its own way. Hence, you should read the corresponding documentation for an algorithm to understand the particular details of using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the search algorithms supported include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Bayesian Optimization](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization): This constrained global optimization process builds upon bayesian inference and gaussian processes. It attempts to find the maximum value of an unknown function in as few iterations as possible. This is a good technique for optimization of high cost functions.\n",
    "* [BOHB (Bayesian Optimization HyperBand](https://github.com/automl/HpBandSter): An algorithm that both terminates bad trials and also uses Bayesian Optimization to improve the hyperparameter search. It is backed by the [HpBandSter](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/api_docs/schedulers.html#tune-scheduler-bohb) library. BOHB is intended to be paired with a specific scheduler class: [HyperBandForBOHB](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/api_docs/schedulers.html#tune-scheduler-bohb).\n",
    "* [HyperOpt](http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt): A Python library for serial and parallel optimization over awkward search spaces, which may include real-valued, discrete, and conditional dimensions.\n",
    "* [Nevergrad](https://github.com/facebookresearch/nevergrad): HPO without computing gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "These and other algorithms are described in the [documentation](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/api_docs/suggestion.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "A limitation of search algorithms used by themselves is they can't affect or stop training processes, for example early stopping of trail that are performing poorly. The schedulers can do this, so it's common to use a compatible search algorithm with a scheduler, as we'll show in the first example."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## About Schedulers\n",
    "\n",
    "Tune includes distributed implementations of several early-stopping algorithms, including the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Median Stopping Rule](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub46180.html): It applies the simple rule that a trial is aborted if the results are trending below the median of the previous trials.\n",
    "* [HyperBand](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06560): It structures search as an _infinite-armed, stochastic, exploration-only, multi-armed bandit_. See the [Multi-Armed Bandits lessons](../ray-rllib/multi-armed-bandits/00-Multi-Armed-Bandits-Overview.ipynb) for information on these concepts. The infinite arms correspond to the tunable parameters. Trying values stochastically ensures quick exploration of the parameter space. Exploration-only is desirable because for HPO, we aren't interested in _exploiting_ parameter combinations we've already tried (the usual case when using MABs where rewards are the goal). Intead, we need to explore as many new parameter combinations as possible.\n",
    "* [ASHA](https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Y7OOlRZ). This is an aynchronous version of HyperBand that improves on the latter. Hence it is recommended over the original HyperBand implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tune also includes a distributed implementation of [Population Based Training (PBT)](https://deepmind.com/blog/population-based-training-neural-networks). When the PBT scheduler is enabled, each trial variant is treated as a member of the _population_. Periodically, top-performing trials are checkpointed, which means your [`tune.Trainable`](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/api_docs/trainable.html#tune-trainable) object (e.g., the `TrainMNist` class we used in the previous exercise) has to support save and restore. \n",
    "\n",
    "Low-performing trials clone the checkpoints of top performers and perturb the configurations in the hope of discovering an even better variation. PBT trains a group of models (or RLlib agents) in parallel. So, unlike other hyperparameter search algorithms, PBT mutates hyperparameters during training time. This enables very fast hyperparameter discovery and also automatically discovers good [annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) schedules.\n",

    "The runs in the previous lesson, for the class-based and the function-based Tune APIs, took between 12 and 20 seconds (on my machine), but we only trained for 20 iterations, where as here we went for 100 iterations. That also accounts for the different results, notably that a much smaller momentum value `0.01` and `0.1` perform best here, while for the the previous lesson `0.9` performed best. This is because a smaller momentum value will result in longer training times required, but more fine-tuned iterating to the optimal result, so more training iterations will favor a smaller momentum value. Still, the mean accuracies among the top three or four combinations are quite close."
