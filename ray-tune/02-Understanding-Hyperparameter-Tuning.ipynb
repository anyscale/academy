Another recent webinar [Fast and efficient hyperparameter tuning with Ray Tune](https://www.anyscale.com/events/2021/10/20/fast-scalable-hyperparameter-tuning-ray-tune) complements the discussion here."

    "## What Are Hyperparameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "In _supervised learning_, we train a model with labeled data so the model can properly label new data values. Everything about the model is defined by a set of _parameters_, such as the weights in a linear regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the _hyperparameters_<sup>1</sup> define structural details about the kind of model itself, like whether or not we are using a linear regression or what architecture is best for a neural network, etc. Other quantities considered hyperparameters include learning rates, discount rates, etc. If we want our training process and resulting model to work well, we first need to determine the optimal or near-optimal set of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we determine the optimal hyperparameters? The most straightfoward approach is to perform a loop where we pick a candidate set of values from some reasonably inclusive list of possible values, train a model, compare the results achieved with previous loop iterations, and pick the set that performed best. This process is called _Hyperparameter Tuning_ or _Optimization_ (HPO).\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple algorithm can quickly become very expensive, however. Training a single neural networks can be compute intensive and the space of all possible architectures is huge. Hence, much of the research in hyperparameter tuning, especially for neural networks, focuses on ways to optimize HPO, such as early stopping and pruning the search space when some combinations appear to perform poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Hyperparameter_ is often spelled _hyper parameter_ or _hyper-parameter_, but we'll use the spelling with no space or dash."

    "\n",
    "Let's start with a very simple example of HPO, finding $k$ in $k$-means. \n",
    "\n",
    "The $k$-means algorithm finds clusters in a data set. It's a canonical example of _unsupervised learning_, where information is extracted from a data set, rather than using labeled data to train a model for labelling new data, as in _supervised learning_. We won't discuss the algorithm details, but the essense of it involves a \"guess\" for the expected number of clusters, the $k$ value, then calculating $k$ centroids (the coordinates at the center), one per cluster, along with determining to which cluster each data point belongs. The details are in [$k$-means Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering). The following animation shows the algorithm in action for a two-dimensional data set where three clusters are evident.\n",

In this case, \"best\" would mean that we minimize the distances between the datapoints and centroids. \n",
    "\n",
    "With just one hyperparameter, this problem is comparatively simple and brute force calculations to find the optimal $k$ is usually good enough."

    "\n",
    "[Ray Tune](http://tune.io) is the Ray-based native library for hyperparameter tuning. Tune makes it nearly as easy to run distributed, parallelized HPO as it is to run trials on a single machine manually, one after the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tune is built as an extensible, pluggable framework, with built-in integrations for many frameworks, including [OpenAI Gym environments](https://gym.openai.com/envs/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org), [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org), and recently, [sci-kit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) (see [this recent blog post](https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray/gridsearchcv-2-0-new-and-improved-ee56644cbabf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Tune also integrates implementations of many state-of-the-art [search algorithms](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/api_docs/suggestion.html) and [schedulers](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/api_docs/schedulers.html), so it is easy to optimize your HPO process."

    "> **Aside:** In case you haven't gone through the [Ray RLlib tutorial](../ray-rllib/00-Ray-RLlib-Overview.ipynb), [CartPole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/) is an [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/envs/) environment that simulates a cart that moves left or right while attempting to balance a vertical pole. A _policy_ is trained to optimize changing the velocity up and down to control right and left movement with the goal of keeping the pole balanced for as long as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important hyperparameters for `CartPole` are for the neural network used to learn how to balance the pole. A simple network suffices. We'll use a fully-connected network with two hidden layers, but use Tune to find an optimal choice for the sizes of the layers. To keep the computation tractable for our purposes, we'll just pick sizes from the list of 20 and 40. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's probably that some specific number between these 10 and 100 is optimal for one layer and a different number is optimal for the other layer. However, the computation required for trying all possible combinations is $O(n^2)$. You should consider trying more numbers if you don't mind waiting!\n",
