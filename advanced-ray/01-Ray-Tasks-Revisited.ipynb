    "There are two fundamental problems with the way we've used `ray.get()` so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There's no timeout, in case something gets \"hung\".\n",
    "2. We have to wait for _all_ the objects to be available before `ray.get()` returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to specify a timeout is essential in production code as a defensive measure. Many potential problems could happen in a real production system, any one of which could cause the task we're waiting on to take an abnormally long time to complete or never complete. Our application would be deadlocked waiting on this task. Hence, it's **strongly recommended** in production software to always use timeouts on blocking calls, so that the application can attempt some sort of recovery in situations like this, or at least report the error and \"degrade gracefully\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, there _is_ a `timeout=<value>` option you can pass to `ray.get()` ([documentation](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/package-ref.html#ray.get)), but it will most likely be removed in a future release of Ray. Why remove it if timeouts are important? This change will simplify the implementation of `ray.get()` and encourage the use of `ray.wait()` for waiting ([documentation](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/package-ref.html#ray.wait)) instead, followed by using `ray.get()` to retrieve values for tasks that `ray.wait()` tells us are finished. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using `ray.wait()` is also the way to fix the second problem with using `ray.get()` by itself, that we have to wait for all tasks to finish before we get any values back. Some of those tasks finish more quickly in our contrived example. We would like to process those results as soon as they are available, even while others continue to run. We'll use `ray.wait()` for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, while `ray.get()` is simple and convenient, for _production code_, we recommend using `ray.wait()`, **with** timeouts, for blocking on running tasks. Then use `ray.get()` to retrieve values of completed tasks. \n",
