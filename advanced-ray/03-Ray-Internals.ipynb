    "### Scheduling and Resource Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray implements a distributed scheduler. The main job of the scheduler is to match tasks (or actors) with resources on a node. The notion of a resource in Ray is fairly general, it can be any `key` -> `float` quantity. For example, `{\"CPU\": 1.0, \"GPU\": 1.0}` can represent a request for 1 CPU and 1 GPU resource. This task can only be scheduled on a node that has >= 1 CPU and >= 1 GPU available. By default, ray auto-detects the CPU, GPU, memory, and object store memory resources on each node, although you can override these values. You can also add other types of arbitrary resources by passing an argument to the `ray start` CLI or at runtime with the [dynamic custom resource API](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/advanced.html#dynamic-custom-resources). By default, a `ray.remote` function will request `{\"CPU\": 1}`. By default, an actor will request `{\"CPU\": 0}` for placement, which means any number of actors can be created in a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that resource limits are not enforced by Ray, except for memory (if requested, and only on a best effort basis for actors). The main purpose of resources is for scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray clients (either a driver or worker) first send task scheduling requests to their local scheduler, also called a **raylet**. The raylet can either fulfill the scheduling request, or redirect the client to retry at a remote raylet that may have the requested resources free. This process is repeated iteratively until the task is successfully scheduled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the raylet process on each node is responsible for tracking resources and scheduling tasks. When a task is scheduled, the raylet tracks the resources used and then assigns the task to a worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "The raylet does not actually directly send tasks to workers. As described in the _Task Lifetime_ section below, clients send a resource request to their local raylet. If the raylet is able to grant the request, it will respond to the client with a worker lease. The lease remains valid as long as the client and leased worker are alive, although to avoid unfairness, clients generally release the worker when no work remains to be done or if window of time has passed (e.g., a few hundred milliseconds). Clients may schedule as many tasks onto the worker, as long as the tasks are compatible with the resource request used to acquire the worker in the first place. Hence, leases can be thought of as an optimization to avoid needing to talk to the scheduler repeatedly for similar scheduling requests.\n",

    "\n",
    "When a scheduler tells a worker to go to another node to request resources, because it has insufficient resources locally, there are two possible scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The scheduler knows of a particular node that may have resources. In this case, the scheduler responds to the client to retry scheduling the task at that node. This is called _spillback_. Spillback can be recursive; if the recommended node can't schedule the resource, it may recommend another node. The client retains full control over exactly which node a task is being scheduled on.\n",
    "2. The scheduler is not aware of any node in the cluster that has resources. This is called an _infeasible task_. The scheduler may emit a warning message and it will hold the task until resources become available.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the scheduler know which nodes are candidates for spilling tasks? For every heartbeat interval (100ms by default), each scheduler sends it's currently available resource slots to the cluster monitor. The monitor process aggregates these heartbeats and rebroadcasts them to each raylet. When a node manager receives this update, it checks if any tasks in its internal queues can be matched with these other nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason each scheduler broadcasts its resource availability periodically is to support dynamic resources, that is resource types added at runtime. A dynamic resource may be very rare, e.g., only present on one node in a large cluster. Hence, schemes such as randomized probing for load balancing would be very inefficient for Ray."
