The minimum valid value is 0 (default), which indicates that the actor doesn't need to be restarted. A value of -1 indicates that an actor should be restarted indefinitely.\n",
    "* `max_task_retries`: How many times to retry an actor task if the task fails due to a system error, e.g., the actor has died. If set to -1, the system will retry the failed task until the task succeeds, or the actor has reached its max_restart limit. If set to to a value `n` greater than 0, the system will retry the failed task up to `n` times, after which time the task will throw a `RayActorError` exception when `ray.get` attempts to retrieve a result. Note that Python exceptions are not considered system errors and will not trigger retries.\n",

Also, for a live tutorial event, this exercise is too much to take on in the limite time available. That's why it's labelled _Homework_. I encourage you to read the solution though."

    "We already proved that running whole games as actors gives us a performance boost when we need to run many of them at once, simply by running the games concurrently across the available CPU cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise explores whether or not we can improve the performance of a single game. This task isn't easy. We'll try a few ideas, but find that many don't provide much improvement. Only doing low-level optimizations provide significant improvement at this point. That could be important in a massive system where every bit of efficiency matters, but _Premature optimization is the root of all evil_. Why? Because optimizations often obscure the logic of the code, making it harder to maintain and bugs more likely. This code does basic math, but a lot of it, and sometimes it's better to crank through it in a single thread."

    "You notice that **one** core was pegged running `RayConwaysRules.step()`. Profiling the result and looking at the flame graph provides more information. As we showed previously in this lesson, most of the time is taken up in `live_neighbors()` and in that method, more than half the time is spent in the _list comprehension_.\n",

    "The solution discussed in the [solutions notebook](solutions/Advanced-Ray-Solutions.ipynb) notebook shows that in fact you can reduce its overhead by about 40%. Not bad. The trick is to process the grid updates in parallel, in. blocks of rows at a time, rather than synchronously iterating through the grid cells (i.e., a \"block\" the size of the whole grid). For larger and larger game sizes, the improvement should be more noticeable.\n",

    "But let's step back for a moment; this is the sort of optimization you do when you _really_ have a compelling reason to squeeze optimal performance out of the code. Hence, for this exercise, it's probably overkill, unless you're interested in low-level performance optimizations like this. If you are, see the discussion in the _Solutions_ notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other, easier experiments you can try may not not produce much improvement, based on the flame graph results above, but consider trying them for \"practice\". Look at `RayGame.step()` and `RayConwaysRules.step()`. There are a bunch of remote calls in there. What refactoring could be done that might improve performance? For example, what about extending `RayConwaysRules.step()` to accept a `num_steps` argument like `RayGames2.step()` supports, then modify the call to it from `RayGames.step()`? Does this actually improve performance or not? Don't forget to watch the Dashboard."
