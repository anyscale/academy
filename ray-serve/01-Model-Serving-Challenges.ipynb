    "## The Challenges of Model Serving\n",
    "\n",
    "Model development happens in a data science research environment. There are many challenges, but also tools at the data scientists disposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model deployment to production faces an entirely different set of challenges and requires different tools, although it is desirable to bridge the divide as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a partial lists of the challenges of model serving:\n",
    "\n",
    "### It Should Be Framework Agnostic\n",
    "\n",
    "Model serving frameworks must be able to serve models from popular systems like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, or even arbitrary Python functions. Even within the same organization, it is common to use several machine learning frameworks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, machine learning models are typically surrounded by lots of application logic. For example, some model serving is implemented as a RESTful service to which scoring requests are made. Often this is too restrictive, as some additional processing may be desired as part of the scoring process, and the performance overhead of remote calls may be suboptimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pure Python\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been common recently for model serving to be done using JVM-based systems, since many production enterprises are JVM-based. This is a disadvantage when model training and other data processing are done using Python tools, only. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, model serving should be intuitive for developers and simple to configure and run. Hence, it is desirable to use pure Python and to avoid verbose configurations using YAML files or other means. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data scientists and engineers use Python to develop their machine learning models, so they should also be able to use Python to deploy their machine learning applications. This need is growing more critical as online learning applications combine training and serving in the same applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple and Scalable\n",
    "\n",
    "Model serving must be simple to scale on demand across many machines. It must also be easy to upgrade models dynamically, over time. Achieving production uptime and performance requirements are essential for success.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DevOps Integrations\n",
    "\n",
    "Model serving deployments need to integrate with existing \"DevOps\" CI/CD practices for controlled, audited, and predicatble releases. Patterns like [Canary Deployment](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html) are particularly useful for testing the efficacy of a new model before replacing existing models, just as this pattern is useful for other software deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flexible Deployment Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "There are unique deployment patterns, too. For example, it should be easy to deploy a forest of models, to split traffic to different instances, and to score data in batches for greater efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "See also this [Ray blog post](https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray/the-simplest-way-to-serve-your-nlp-model-in-production-with-pure-python-d42b6a97ad55) on the challenges of model serving and the way Ray Serve addresses them. It also provides an example of starting with a simple model, then deploying a more sophisticated model into the running application."

    "## Why Ray Serve?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Ray Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html) is a scalable model-serving library built on [Ray](https://ray.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "For users, Ray Serve offers these benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Framework Agnostic**: You can use the same toolkit to serve everything from deep learning models built with [PyTorch](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/tutorials/pytorch.html#serve-pytorch-tutorial), [Tensorflow](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/tutorials/tensorflow.html#serve-tensorflow-tutorial), or [Keras](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/tutorials/tensorflow.html#serve-tensorflow-tutorial), to [scikit-Learn](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/tutorials/sklearn.html#serve-sklearn-tutorial) models, to arbitrary business logic.\n",
    "* **Python First:** Configure your model serving with pure Python code. No YAML or JSON configurations required.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a library, Ray Serve enables the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Splitting traffic between backends dynamically](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/advanced.html#serve-split-traffic) with zero downtime. This is accomplished by decoupling routing logic from response handling logic.\n",
    "* [Support for batching](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/advanced.html#serve-batching) to improve performance helps you meet your performance objectives. You can also use a model for batch and online processing.\n",
    "* Because Serve is a library, it's esay to integrate it with other tools in your environment, such as CI/CD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Serve is built on Ray, it also allows you to scale to many machines, in your datacenter or in cloud environments, and it allows you to leverage all of the other Ray frameworks."
