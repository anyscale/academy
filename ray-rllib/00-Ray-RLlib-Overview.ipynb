    "\n",
    "_Multi-Armed Bandits_ (MABs) are a special kind of RL problem that have broad and growing applications. They are also an excellent platform for investigating the important _exploitation vs. exploration tradeoff_ at the heart of RL. The term _multi-armed bandit_ is inspired by the slot machines in casinos, so called _one-armed bandits_, but where a machine might have more than one arm. \n",

    "Start with the introduction material for RL and RLlib:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Ray RLlib Overview](00-Ray-RLlib-Overview.ipynb) - This file\n",
    "* [Introduction to Reinforcement Learning](01-Introduction-to-Reinforcement-Learning.ipynb) \n",
    "* [Introduction to RLlib](02-Introduction-to-RLlib.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then study several of the lessons for multi-armed bandits, starting with these lessons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Multi-Armed-Bandits Overview](multi-armed-bandits/00-Multi-Armed-Bandits-Overview.ipynb)\n",
    "* [Introduction to Multi-Armed Bandits](multi-armed-bandits/01-Introduction-to-Multi-Armed-Bandits.ipynb)\n",
    "* [Exploration vs. Exploitation Strategies](multi-armed-bandits/02-Exploration-vs-Exploitation-Strategies.ipynb): Skim at least the first part of this lesson. \n",
    "* [Simple Multi-Armed Bandit](multi-armed-bandits/03-Simple-Multi-Armed-Bandit.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "As time permits, study one or both of the following lessons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Linear Upper Confidence Bound](multi-armed-bandits/04-Linear-Upper-Confidence-Bound.ipynb)\n",
    "* [Linear Thompson Sampling](multi-armed-bandits/05-Linear-Thompson-Sampling.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then finish with this more complete example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Market Example](multi-armed-bandits/06-Market-Example.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, return to the \"exploration\" lessons under `explore-rllib` and work through as many of the following lessons as time permits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Application: Cart Pole](explore-rllib/03-Application-Cart-Pole.ipynb): Further exploration of the popular _CartPole_ example.\n",
    "* [Application: Bipedal Walker](explore-rllib/04-Bipedal-Walker.ipynb): A nontrivial, but simplified robot simulator.\n",
    "* [Custom Environments and Reward Shaping](explore-rllib/05-Custom-Environments-Reward-Shaping.ipynb): More about creating custom environments for your problem. Also, finetuning the rewards to ensure sufficient exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other examples that use different OpenAI Gym environments are provided for your use in the `extras` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Extra: Application - Mountain Car](explore-rllib/extras/Extra-Application-Mountain-Car.ipynb)\n",
    "* [Extra: Application - Taxi](explore-rllib/extras/Extra-Application-Taxi.ipynb)\n",
