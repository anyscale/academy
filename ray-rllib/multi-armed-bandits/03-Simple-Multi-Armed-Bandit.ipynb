    "For this simple example, we can easily determine the best actions to take. Let's see how well our system does. We'll train with [LinUCB](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib-algorithms.html?highlight=greedy#linear-upper-confidence-bound-contrib-linucb), a linear version of _Upper Confidence Bound_, for the exploration-exploitation strategy. _LinUCB_ assumes a linear dependency between the expected reward of an action and its context. Recall that a linear function is of the form $z = ax + by + c$, for example, where $x$, $y$, and $z$ are variables and $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. _LinUCB_ models the representation space using a set of linear predictors. Hence, the $Q_t(a)$ _value_ function discussed for UCB in the [previous lesson](02-Exploration-vs-Exploitation-Strategies.ipynb) is assumed to be a linear function here.\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, for each arm, the reward is linear in the context. For example, the first arm has a reward of `-10` for context `-1.0` and `10` for context `1.0`. Crucially, the _same_ linear function that works for the first arm will work for the other two arms if you multiplied the constants in the linear function by `0` and `-1`, respectively. Hence, we expect _LinUCB_ to work well for this example."
