    "_Reinforcement Learning_ is the category of machine learning that focuses on training one or more _agents_ to achieve maximal _rewards_ while operating in an environment. This lesson discusses the core concepts of RL, while subsequent lessons explore RLlib in depth. We'll use two examples with exercises to give you a taste of RL. If you already understand RL concepts, you can either skim this lesson or skip to the [next lesson](02-Introduction-to-RLlib.ipynb)."

    "## What Is Reinforcement Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore the basic concepts of RL, specifically the _Markov Decision Process_ abstraction, and to show its use in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following image:\n",
    "\n",
    "![RL Concepts](../images/rllib/RL-concepts.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In RL, one or more **agents** interact with an **environment** to maximize a **reward**. The agents make **observations** about the **state** of the environment and take **actions** that are believed will maximize the long-term reward. However, at any particular moment, the agents can only observe the immediate reward. So, the training process usually involves lots and lot of replay of the game, the robot simulator traversing a virtual space, etc., so the agents can learn from repeated trials what decisions/actions work best to maximize the long-term, cumulative reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trail and error search and delayed reward are the distinguishing characterists of RL vs. other ML methods ([Sutton 2018](06-RL-References.ipynb#Books)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to formalize trial and error is the **exploitation vs. exploration tradeoff**. When an agent finds what appears to be a \"rewarding\" sequence of actions, the agent may naturally want to continue to **exploit** these actions. However, even better actions may exist. An agent won't know whether alternatives are better or not unless some percentage of actions taken **explore** the alternatives. So, all RL algorithms include a strategy for exploitation and exploration."

    "\n",
    "An MDP models sequential interactions with an external environment. It consists of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a **state space** where the current state of the system is sometimes called the **context**.\n",
    "- a set of **actions** that can be taken at a particular state $s$ (or sometimes the same set for all states).\n",
    "- a **transition function** that describes the probability of being in a state $s'$ at time $t+1$ given that the MDP was in state $s$ at time $t$ and action $a$ was taken. The next state is selected stochastically based on these probabilities.\n",

    "The goal of MDP is to develop a **policy** $\\pi$ that specifies what action $a$ should be chosen for a given state $s$ so that the cumulative reward is maximized. When it is possible for the policy \"trainer\" to fully observe all the possible states, actions, and rewards, it can define a deterministic policy, fixing a single action choice for each state. In this scenario, the transition probabilities reduce to the probability of transitioning to state $s'$ given the current state is $s$, independent of actions, because the state now leads to a deterministic action choice. Various algorithms can be used to compute this policy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Put another way, if the policy isn't deterministic, then the transition probability to state $s'$ at a time $t+1$ when action $a$ is taken for state $s$ at time $t$, is given by:\n",

    "## The Elements of RL\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the elements of RL that expand on MDP concepts (see [Sutton 2018](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning-second-edition) for more details):\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike MDP, the **transition function** probabilities are often not known in advance, but must be learned. Learning is done through repeated \"play\", where the agent interacts with the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the **policy** $\\pi$ harder to determine. Because the fully state space usually can't be fully known, the choice of action $a$ for given state $s$ almostly always remains a stochastic choice, never deterministic, unlike MDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reward Signal\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of a **reward signal** encapsulates the desired goal for the system and provides feedback for updating the policy based on how well particular events or actions contribute rewards towards the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Value Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The **value function** encapsulates the maximum cumulative reward likely to be achieved starting from a given state for an **episode**. This is harder to determine than the simple reward returned after taking an action. In fact, much of the research in RL over the decades has focused on finding better and more efficient implementations of value functions. To illustrate the challenge, repeatedly taking one sequence of actions may yield low rewards for a while, but eventually provide large rewards. Conversely, always choosing a different sequence of actions may yield a good reward at each step, but be suboptimal for the cumulative reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Episode\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence of steps by the agent starting in an initial state. At each step, the agent observes the current state, chooses the next action, and receives the new reward. Episodes are used for both training policies and replaying with an existing policy (called _rollout_).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model\n",
    "\n",
    "An optional feature, some RL algorithms develop or use a **model** of the environment to anticipate the resulting states and rewards for future actions. Hence, they are useful for _planning_ scenarios. Methods for solving RL problems that use models are called _model-based methods_, while methods that learn by trial and error are called _model-free methods_."

Here is an image from that website, where the pole is currently falling to the right, which means the cart will need to move to the right to restore balance:\n",

    "- The **state** consists of the position and velocity of the cart (moving in one dimension from left to right) as well as the angle and angular velocity of the pole that is balancing on the cart.\n",
    "- The **actions** are to decrease or increase the cart's velocity by one unit. A negative velocity means it is moving to the left.\n",
    "- The **transition function** is deterministic and is determined by simulating physical laws. Specifically, for a given **state**, what should we choose as the next velocity value? In the RL context, the correct velocity value to choose has to be learned. Hence, we learn a _policy_ that approximates the optimal transition function that could be calculated from the laws of physics.\n",
    "- The **reward function** is a constant 1 as long as the pole is upright, and 0 once the pole has fallen over. Therefore, maximizing the reward means balancing the pole for as long as possible.\n",

    "PPO works in two phases. In the first phase, a large number of rollouts are performed in parallel. The rollouts are then aggregated on the driver and a surrogate optimization objective is defined based on those rollouts. In the second phase, we use SGD (_stochastic gradient descent_) to find the policy that maximizes that objective with a penalty term for diverging too much from the current policy.\n",
