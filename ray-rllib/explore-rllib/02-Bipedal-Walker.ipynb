    "Reward is given for moving forward, a total of 300+ points up to the far end. If the robot falls, it gets -100. Applying motor torque costs a small amount of points, so a more optimal agent that minimizes torque application will get a better score. The state consists of the hull angle speed, angular velocity, horizontal speed, vertical speed, position of joints, joints angular speed, legs contact with ground, and 10 LIDAR rangefinder measurements. There are no coordinates in the state vector.\n",

    "This notebook requires more computation than the other lessons to achieve a well-trained policy. However, to make it faster, we provide a checkpoint from previous training episodes, which will accelerate your efforts somewhat. Even starting with the provided checkpoint, you'll see good results. However, consider iterating on the neural network structure and run more training iterations. How well can you train the walker?"
