    "This example uses [RLlib](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rllib.html) to train a policy with the `MountainCar-v0` environment, ([gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/]. The idea is that a cart starts at an arbitrar point on a hill. Without any \"pushes\", it will rock back and forth between the two sides of the valley below, never rising above the starting point. However, there are three actions, accelerate to the left (by some unit), accelerate to the right, or apply no acceleration. Timing accelerations in the appropriate directions at the appropriate steps is the key to getting to the top of the hill.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary idea demonstrated in this lesson is how to start from a previous checkpoint. A checkpoint is provided in the `mountain-car-checkpoint` directory, captured after 200 training episodes. Still, the with the provided checkpoint and addition training of 50 episodes, the cart is unable to reach the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, you should consider this lesson a big exercise to try when you aren't pressed for time (like in a class setting). Modifications you can try are discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** This rollout can only show the rollout visualization popup windows when running on a local laptop.\n",
