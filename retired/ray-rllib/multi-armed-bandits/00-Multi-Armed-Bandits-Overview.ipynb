    "| 00  | [Multi-Armed-Bandits Overview](00-Multi-Armed-Bandits-Overview.ipynb) | Overview of this set of lessons. |\n",
    "| 01  | [Introduction to Multi-Armed Bandits](01-Introduction-to-Multi-Armed-Bandits.ipynb) | A quick introduction to the concepts of multi-armed bandits (MABs) and how they fit in the spectrum of RL problems. |\n",
    "| 02  | [Exploration vs. Exploitation Strategies](02-Exploration-vs-Exploitation-Strategies.ipynb) | A deeper look at algorithms that balance exploration vs. exploitation, the key challenge for efficient solutions. Much of this material is technical and can be skipped in a first reading, but skim the first part of this lesson at least. |\n",
    "| 03  | [Simple Multi-Armed Bandit](03-Simple-Multi-Armed-Bandit.ipynb) | A simple example of a multi-armed bandit to illustrate the core ideas. |\n",
    "| 04  | [Linear Upper Confidence Bound](04-Linear-Upper-Confidence-Bound.ipynb) | One popular algorithm for exploration vs. exploitation is _Upper Confidence Bound_. This lesson shows how to use a linear version in RLlib. |\n",
    "| 05  | [Linear Thompson Sampling](05-Linear-Thompson-Sampling.ipynb) | Another popular algorithm for exploration vs. exploitation is _Thompson Sampling_. This lesson shows how to use a linear version in RLlib. |\n",
