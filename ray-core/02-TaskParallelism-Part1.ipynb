If `ray.init()` worked (for example, you see a message like _View the Ray dashboard at localhost:8265_) and you're using a Mac, you may get several annoying dialogs asking you if you want to allow incoming connections for `python` and/or `redis-server`. Click \"Accept\" for each one and they shouldn't appear again during this lesson. MacOS is trying to verify if these executables have been properly signed. Ray uses Redis. If you installed Python using Anaconda or other mechanism, then it probably isn't properly signed from the point of view of MacOS.

    "As before, each asynchronous task still takes roughly `n` seconds to finish (for `n` equals 0 through 15). This makes sense, because each `expensive_task` does essentially nothing but sleep, and since there's only one task per worker, there should be no apreciable difference for the individual times, as before. \n",

It finished in 8 seconds, so the _total_ time for the 0-second and 8-second tasks was about 8 seconds. Similarly, after the 1-second task finished, the 9-second task was scheduled. Total time: 10 seconds. Using induction ;), the last worker started with the 7-second task followed by the 15-second task for a total of 22 seconds!\n",
