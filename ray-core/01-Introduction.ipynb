    "# What Is Ray?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Ray](https://ray.io) is a system for scaling Python applications from your laptop to a cluster with relative ease. It emerged from the [RISELab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/) at Berkeley in response to the problems researchers faced writing advanced ML applications and libraries that could easily scale to a cluster. These researchers found that none of the existing solutions were flexible enough and easy enough to use for their needs. Hence, Ray was born. "

    "* **Featurization:** Features are the data \"attributes\" that appear to be most useful for modeling the domain.\n",
    "* **Streaming:** New data often arrives in realtime and may be processed in realtime, too.\n",
    "* **Hyperameter Tuning:** What are the best kinds of models for this domain? When using neural networks, what is the ideal _architecture_ for the network? This model \"metadata\" is also called the _hyperparameters_. Since discovering the hyperparameters can be an expensive process of training lots of candidates, specialized techniques in their own right have merged for this purpose, as we'll learn in the _Ray Tune_ module.\n",
    "* **Training:** Once the best (or at least good enough) hyperparameters are chosen, the model has to be trained on real data and sometimes retrained periodically as new data arrives.\n",
    "* **Simulation:** An important part of many _reinforcement learning_ applications is running a simulator, such as a game engine or robot simulation, against which the RL system is trained to maximize the \"reward\" when operating in that environment or the real analog. The simulator is one example of a compute pattern that is quite a bit different from the normal \"dataflow\" or query-like patterns that many big data tools support well. Also, this simulator may be run many, many times as part of the hyperameter tuning or training process, requiring efficient, cluster-wide execution.\n",
    "* **Model Serving:** Finally, when the model is trained, it needs to be served, so that it can be applied to new data, sometimes with low latency requirements."
