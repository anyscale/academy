    "### Introduction to Ray Train\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray Train is a library that aims to simplify distributed deep learning. As a library, Ray Train is built to abstract away the coordination/configuration setup of distributed deep learning frameworks such as [Pytorch Distributed](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dist_overview.html) and [Tensorflow Distributed](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training), allowing users to only focus on implementing training logic for their respective framework. For example: \n",
    " * For Pytorch, Ray Train automatically handles the construction of the distributed process group.\n",
    " * For Tensorflow, Ray Train automatically handles the coordination of the `TF_CONFIG`. The current implementation assumes that the user will use a _MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy_, but this will change in the near future.\n",
    " * For Horovod, Ray Train automatically handles the construction of the Horovod runtime and [Rendezvous server](https://horovod.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_modules/horovod/ray/runner.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Built for data scientists/ML practitioners, Ray Train has support for standard ML tools and features that practitioners love. For example:\n",
    " * Callbacks for early stopping, reducing costs and time for training\n",
    " * Checkpointing at regular intervals, allowing to restart for fault-tolerence\n",
    " * Integration with Tensorboard, Weights/Biases, and MLflow, providing extensibilty for experimentation and observation of runs\n",
    " * Jupyter notebooks, giving developers familiar development tools for iteration and experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, Ray Train integrates with the Ray Ecosystem. Distributed deep learning often comes with a lot of complexity, so you can:\n",
    " * Use [Ray Datasets](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/dataset.html#datasets) with Ray Train to inject, handle or train on large amounts of data\n",
    " * Use [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html#tune-main) with Ray Train to leverage cutting edge hyperparameter techniques and distribute both your training and tuning\n",
    " * Use the [Ray cluster launcher](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/cloud.html#cluster-cloud) to launch and leverage autoscaling or spot instance clusters to train your model at scale on any cloud"
